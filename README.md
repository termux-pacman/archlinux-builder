# archlinux-builder
This is a build of docker images which has preinstalled packages (`base-devel`, `python`, `ruby` ​​and etc.) for compiling other packages.

The assembly is divided into the following tags (these tags indicate the architecture of the assembly):
 - aarch64
 - armv7h
 - x86_64
 - i686

To work with `makepkg`, the assembly has a `user-build` user to work with it.
